              <h2> <em>About Me<em></h2>
            

              <p id="firstp">            Hi my name is Patrick Boucicault and I am a Web/App Developer. I'm 21 years old and a student
              at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/"> Stony Brook University </a>. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and I hope to one day
              be an exceptional Software Engineer. My goal is to eventually have my own technology company
              where we can build things to help improve the lives of All.
              </p>

              <p id="secondP">
              My academic life started off very poorly. I hated doing work, and I always had issues 
              with my teachers. This lasted from elementary school up until Freshmen year of college. 
              After graduating from highschool in 2013, I attended <a href="http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/">Queensborough Community College.</a>
              I got involved with the Gaming Club in my first semester, and during my second, I 
              became the club President. Because I was always in the Technology building I had the 
              opportunity to meet the Student Government President, Mr. Jones. He was an older man who 
              always told it like it was. He always gave me constructive criticism (even when I didn't
              want to hear it). Towards the end of my second semester I ran for the position of Student
              Government President, and with the help of Mr. Jones, I won. This was where things started
              really looking up for me.</p>

              <p id="thirdP">
               My two semsters as Student Government President was the time I grew the most. During 
              that year I worked with a great team of people who are now some of my closest friends.
              We went to many different leadership conferences, and sat in meetings with Faculty and 
              Administration. I also had the opportunity to give a speech during graduation to the class
              of 2015. During my second semester of being President I took my first Computer Science class.
              It was difficult for me at first, but thanks to a good friend and mentor of mine, Nick, who
              was the advisor of the gaming club, I was able to do well. Soon after I finished my term,
              I transferred to Stony Brook.</p>

              <p id="fourthP">

               Since beginning my education at Stony Brook I've learned a lot of new things about programming.
              I started off with procedural programming in C++ at Queensborough, then I learned Java oriented
              programming at Stony Brook. I also learned a lot about data structures. 
              I've also taught myself HTML,CSS, and Javascript so I could build websites.</p>
